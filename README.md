Vibe Cast is an interactive front-end web application built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Inspired by my pet bunny named Oggy, the project blends functionality with personality by combining multiple dynamic features into a cohesive user experience.

The application includes:

- A weather app that retrieves and displays real-time weather data based on a user-entered city.
- A bunny character that dynamically changes outfits depending on the current weather conditions.
- A seasonal background system that updates visuals based on the time of year.
- A live clock displaying local time, along with a built-in stopwatch feature.
- A calendar that automatically shows the current date.
- A to-do list for task management.
- Interactive UI elements, including clickable outfit color changes for the bunny.

The project demonstrates DOM manipulation, conditional logic, animations, event handling, API integration, and dynamic styling. It reflects both technical skills and creative design thinking, combining multiple front-end components into a unified and engaging application.
